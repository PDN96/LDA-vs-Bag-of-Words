LDA was implemented for both the artificial and the 20newsgroups datasets. Comparision was done between the Bag of Words model and the dimensionally reduced LDA features model.
It was concluded that dimensionality reduction performed by LDA preserves the inherent structure of the data and it can be used effectively for document classification especially if training data size is small.
